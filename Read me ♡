Hi there i'm Biscuit and I usually hang around in Ponytown.
Sometimes I would hang around at the market, forest at bottom right corner or at the beach.
I enjoy chatting but do approach with caution, an unexpected boop or a cuddle will startle me. (<-- do keep this in mind even if it is a game)
I do love MLP and the horror fanficts, silent hill, Resident Evil, Alice in Madness, Until Dawn etc..
My favourite books is Jekyll and Hyde.
My favourite show is Hunch Back of Notre Dame.
I do love gore and horror movies/series such as Jigsaw.

I do love to make new friends, so don't hesitate to approach. ♡
-:Treat how you want to be treated.:-

If I am afk/writing a story, give me a moment to come back to you.
But If I have a skin with 'On edge' please be mindful, I may not be okay to talk atm.
